# Avoiding the pitfalls of direct linkage: A novelty-driven approach to measuring scientific impact on patents

This repository contains data from the paper "Avoiding the pitfalls of direct linkage: A novelty-driven approach to measuring scientific impact on patents". The file "DSS_Inclusion.csv" contains the patent number of every patent used and the results of the similariy calculation with DSS-Inclusion, which are also the results for science-driven novelty. Additional data is available upon request.
